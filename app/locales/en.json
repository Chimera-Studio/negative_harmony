    "paragraph_2": "The negative chord names may not always be exactly right because of the way the chord naming system works.\n\nIn practise the chord name comes from the tonic/root note followed by the structure/pattern (major, minor, suspended...) this rule is broken when looking at negative chords where the tonic/root is actually the last note played going from left to right on the piano.\n\nBecause of this, the app looks if the negative chord pattern has a match when mirrored and compared to the regular one. If so it determines the chord name by taking the 'negative' tonic/root note and displaying the chord name.\n\nThough the chord name may vary depending on what you consider to be the tonic/root note the notes displayed in the negative chords are always correct.",
